# Sign Avenue LLC Project

The goal of this project is to create a website for Sign Avenue with the assistance of AI.

I will be making a simple website with Home, Portfolio, Services, About, and Contact.

I will also create a user dashboard to track ongoing projects and assign installation.  On the other side of that, I will create an admin dashboard where admins can see all projects, contact requests, scheduling board, and control all files and details of customer projects.  Admins will also have a built in Accounting section where they can keep track of customer payments and balances, as well as create invoice pdfs to send to users.
